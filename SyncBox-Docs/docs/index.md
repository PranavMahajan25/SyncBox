# Welcome to SyncBox! 
A synchronization measures toolbox.


SyncBox implements a total of 9 synchronization measures (6 symmetric and 3 directional measures). 
These measures computed from the timeseries data can be used to investigate dynamical systems treating them as blackboxes. 
Our work is largely influenced and organized as per the review chapter by Thomas Kreuz [1].
The following measures are included in SyncBox,

#### Symmetric: 

* Spectral Coherence 
* Phase locking value
* Normalized Shannon Entropy
* Conditional Probability Index
* Mutual Information
* Cross correlation

#### Directional:

* Transfer entropy
* Phase transfer entropy (PTE) and differential PTE
* Directed Nonlinear Interdependence


Feel free to refer to `References/Toolbox functions` for more details.

#### About: 
This toolbox is built by [Pranav Mahajan](https://pranavmahajan25.github.io/portfolio/) and [Advait Rane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/advait-rane-858b10190/?originalSubdomain=in), under the supervision of [Swapna Sasi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=UtIwuWcAAAAJ) and [Dr. Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/basabdattab/profile). 
We hope these tools will be useful to neuroscientists, information theorists, physicists, communication engineers and more.
